Code for "TanSat-2: a new satellite for mapping solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence at both red and far-red bands with high spatiotemporal resolution"
The TanSat-2 satellite is specifically designed for global carbon inventory verification. It features a wide swath of 2900 km and high spatial resolution of 2 km at an orbit altitude of 7000 km, providing near-daily global baseline coverage. Its broad spectral grasp, combined with high spectral resolution, enables dual-band (red and far-red) solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) retrievals with unprecedented accuracy.

We developed a data-driven SIF retrieval framework tailored to TanSat-2. Empirical coefficients in the dual-channel scheme were systematically tuned using forward spectral simulations, yielding an optimised algorithm that fully exploits TanSat-2â€™s two-band observations for high-precision SIF mapping.
